# SRCNN using Lasagne on Jupyter Notebook
 For my Final-Year Seminar I reviewed the paper "Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional 
 Networks" and made a narrative code in jupyter notebook implementing the SRCNN. I also made a
 presentation, where I talk about the regularization theory, and this paper. My super-ambitious plan 
 was to work towards extending the Regularization theory to Image Super-resolution.

This is a notebook on theano based Image-super resolution based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092).
This implementation is based on the implementation of ['corochann'](https://github.com/corochann).
The original codes of this implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/corochann/theanonSR).
The images used have been taken from [here](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/SelfExSR)
This is all work of the original authors of the papers. The purpose of this notebook is only to make the process 
easier to comprehend and give a toy example of how to implement it.
